##Overview
Development Workspace automation bot.

##Motivation
What if PC/Laptop crashes ? Bummer.

Hate installing packages manually or searching online to check for the steps needed to install
something.

So wanted to backup the stuff I use so that I could easily setup my development environment in whichever PC/Laptop I wanted to.

##Running

Run ```make -s list``` to get a list of all targets and then run a specific ```make target``` to setup the particular environment.

##Contributing

Fork charizard and add your own packages and configurations. If there is a must install package/utility, send
me a pull request and I'll add it.
