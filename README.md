#DevSetup

##Overview
Development Workspace automation tool.

##Motivation
Hate installing packages manually or searching online to check for the steps needed to install
something.

##Running

```sh
sudo chmod +x workspace_setup.sh
./workspace_setup.sh
```

##Contributing

Fork it and add your own packages and configurations. If it's a must install package/utility, send
me a pull request and I'll add it.
